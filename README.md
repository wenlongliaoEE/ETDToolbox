# ETDToolbox
This is the user manual of toolbox in the paper named "An Open-Source Toolbox with Classical Classifiers for Electricity Theft Detection" 

1. English version manual

Initially I posted the toolkit on the website:https://www.jianshu.com/p/b12df6a004ee. It is now moved to github.

It includes four files. After the user selects all the files, tap the Download button.

Toolbox: A group of .fig files with the graphical user interface (GUI) and a set of .m files with basic codes of the data generator and classical classifiers.

Raw data: real household power load profiles from block 1 of smart meters in low carbon London.

Generated data: The authors have used the raw data to generate the dataset. The user can use the author's data.

Original codes:  a set of .m files. Toolbox is relatively inflexible, and users can modify the structure of the classifier with source code.
