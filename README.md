Electricity Theft Detection Toolbox

This repository provides an open-source toolbox for electricity theft detection, featuring classical classifiers and a data generator. The toolbox was originally hosted on JianShu and has now been moved to GitHub for better accessibility and version control.


Toolbox Overview

The toolbox consists of four main components:

1. Toolbox
   A collection of .fig files providing a graphical user interface (GUI).
   A set of .m files containing the core code for data generation and classical classifiers.

2. Raw Data
   Real household power load profiles from Block 1 of smart meters in the Low Carbon London project.
   
3. Generated Data
   The dataset generated from raw data, as used by the authors in their research. Users can directly utilize this dataset.

4. Original Codes
   A set of .m files containing the original source code.
   Unlike the GUI-based toolbox, this version is more flexible, allowing users to modify the structure of the classifiers.

How to Download
   To access the toolbox, select all files and click the Download button.
